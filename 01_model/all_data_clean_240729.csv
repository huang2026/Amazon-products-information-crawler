Calcium Citrate is designed to maintain your bone density and strengthen your bones. It is an effective preventative measure in fighting against health issues. Incorporate this kit into your diet today to start protecting your skeleton.SUPPORTS HEART HEALTH: Calcium also plays an important role in the contraction and relaxation of cardiac muscle tissues. Thus, adequate calcium intake is quite necessary to maintain cardiac health. Consult a doctor before use if you have a heart condition and are unsure if this supplement is right for you.BIOAVAILABLE INGREDIENTS: Calcium citrateâs common counterpart is calcium carbonate. Unlike citrate, carbonate neutralizes stomach acid and, therefore, is hard to digest, making our supplement the more effective and easier-to-absorb choice. With so many calcium supplements out there, it may be difficult to know which one to choose. Thatâs why we made ours from the best ingredients out there.BONE DENSITY AID: Apart from bone formation and reversing bone resorption, calcium also plays another role in maintaining bone health; it stabilizes and increases bone density. Bone density is one of the main factors contributing to your bodyâs resistance to bone injury and disease. You increase chances of avoiding broken bones and diseases like osteoporosis when you receive sufficient calcium.REJUVENATION THERAPEUTICS: At Rejuvenation Therapeutics, we aim to make proper nutrition and natural vegan supplements accessible to everyone who is looking into improving their health and lifestyle. It is our mission to create a world in which everyone is active, happy, and healthy for many years to come.

While alpha-tocopherol has beneficial effects of its own, it has been shown to interfere with the positive effects of tocotrienols, and it also inhibits absorption of tocotrienols. For this reason, it's best to take tocotrienols by themselves.*Why Switch to Tocotrienols? Tocopherol has antioxidant effects, but tocotrienol may be up to 40-60x more potent at protecting against cellular damage from harmful free radicals. This is due to its smaller and more flexible molecular structure, helping tocotrienol to be more easily incorporated into cell membranes.*A Single, Premium Source - The richest known source of naturally occurring tocotrienols is annatto, a tree native to Latin America. Delta-tocotrienol sourced from the annatto plant (Bixa orellana) have shown impressive effects in supporting overall health.*Higher Standards, Better Results - This product is made without GMOs, Gluten, Dairy, or Soy. Eco-conscious, tinted glass bottles offer a moisture barrier against moisture and oxygen, which helps protect nutrient viability.*Over 50,000 Doctors Agree - Designs for Health is the physician's choice for top quality professional strength supplements since 1989.

Fibrenza harnesses potent systemic enzymes that break down proteins, toxins, and other cellular debris, such as Serrapeptase and Nattokinaseâpromoting powerful fibrin defense essential for a healthy cardiovascular system.ANTIOXIDANT: Not only are systemic enzymes powerful anti-fibrin agents, but they also possess profound antioxidant properties. The foundation of anti-aging and detoxification protocols, Superoxide Dismutase helps break down potentially harmful oxygen molecules in cells that can cause tissue damage for better overall well-being.SUPERIOR DELIVERY: Fibrenza utilizes a technologically advanced capsule without phthalates or chemicals. Unlike enteric coatings, AcidDefenz capsules use a non-GMO vegetable cellulose barrier to provide maximum protection against harsh stomach acids.

Tocopherol has antioxidant effects, but tocotrienol may be up to 40-60x more potent at protecting against cellular damage from harmful free radicals.A SINGLE, SUPERIOR SOURCE - The richest known source of naturally occurring tocotrienols is annatto, a tree native to Latin America.

While alpha-tocopherol has beneficial effects of its own, it has been shown to interfere with the positive effects of tocotrienols, and it also inhibits absorption of tocotrienols. For this reason, it's best to take tocotrienols by themselves.*Why Switch to Tocotrienols? Tocopherol has antioxidant effects, but tocotrienol may be up to 40-60x more potent at protecting against cellular damage from harmful free radicals. This is due to its smaller and more flexible molecular structure, helping tocotrienol to be more easily incorporated into cell membranes.*A Single, Premium Source - The richest known source of naturally occurring tocotrienols is annatto, a tree native to Latin America. Delta-tocotrienol sourced from the annatto plant (Bixa orellana) have shown impressive effects in supporting overall health.*Higher Standards, Better Results - This product is made without GMOs, Gluten, Dairy, or Soy. Eco-conscious, tinted glass bottles offer a moisture barrier against moisture and oxygen, which helps protect nutrient viability.*Over 50,000 Doctors Agree - Designs for Health is the physician's choice for top quality professional strength supplements since 1989.

Abzorb harnesses potent digestive enzymes that break down macromolecules to help cleanse the intestinal tract and introduces prebiotic inulin, a naturally occurring soluble fiberâpromoting better absorption of nutrients and aid bowel regularity.MICROFLORA & PH BALANCE: Too much acidity, caused by poor diet and environmental factors, can hinder the digestive process and lead to indigestion, bloating, lower metabolism, fatigue, and more. Abzorb's combination of probiotics and elemental magnesium supports a healthier gut biome by introducing healthy microflora and bringing pH levels into balance for improved digestion and further nutrient absorption.SUPERIOR DELIVERY: Abzorb utilizes a technologically advanced capsule without phthalates or chemicals. Unlike other digestive enzyme supplements, our acid-resistant capsules use a non-GMO vegetable cellulose barrier to prevent them from being metabolized in the stomach. They are time-released for increased intestinal cleansing. Take 2 capsules once daily for optimal results.PREMIUM INGREDIENTS: HCP Formulas specializes in ultra-premium nutraceutical supplements to better support your health.
